# ImageVision - Visual Data Interpretation AI System

**ImageVision** is an AI-powered system that utilizes Google Generative AI for visual data interpretation. By allowing users to upload images and ask questions about them, the system dynamically responds with insightful information using the **Gemini API**. This project is designed to help users quickly and accurately interpret visual data, providing efficient solutions to their queries.

## Key Features

- **Image-based Querying**: Upload an image and ask any related question. The AI will analyze the image and generate a response.
- **Google Generative AI Integration**: Leveraging the power of **Google Generative AI**, ImageVision produces detailed and relevant responses for both visual and text-based inputs.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Real-time communication with the AI assistant, allowing continuous interaction with image-based and text-based inputs.
- **Markdown Support**: Responses are displayed with markdown formatting for easy reading.
- **Resource Allocation with AI**: Reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to prioritize issues by urgency.
- **Training Modules**: Integrated AI-based tutor modules to train users on interpreting visual data effectively.

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: Upload an image through the interface by selecting the image file.
2. **Ask Questions**: After uploading the image, input your question, and the AI will process both the text and image to generate a response.
3. **AI Interpretation**: The system processes the visual and textual data, returning an appropriate solution or explanation.
4. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Using reinforcement learning, the system can prioritize more urgent complaints when integrated into support systems.

## Project Structure

- **`ImageVision` Component**: The main component of the project where users can interact with the AI through images and text.
- **Generative AI Model**: Integration of the **Google Generative AI SDK** to provide advanced capabilities for image and text processing.
- **Chat Interface**: Built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, providing an intuitive chat-based interface for user interaction.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImageVision.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ImageVision
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables in a `.env.local` file:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APIKEY=your-google-api-key
   ```

5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Usage

- Upload an image by clicking the `ImagePlus` button.
- Type a question into the chatbox and press `Enter` or click the `Send` button.
- Watch as the AI analyzes the image and provides a response in real-time.

## Dependencies

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React-based framework for building web applications.
- [Google Generative AI SDK](https://developers.generativeai.google/) - AI engine for text and image interpretation.
- [Lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/) - Icons for the interface.
- [React-Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) - For rendering markdown in the chat responses.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced AI Tutor Modules**: Personalized AI tutor systems will provide training on visual data interpretation, helping users understand the reasoning behind AI responses.
- **Resource Allocation**: Use reinforcement learning to prioritize high-priority issues for dynamic resolution.
